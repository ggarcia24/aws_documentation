# KMS

**AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)** is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. The master keys that you create in AWS KMS are protected by FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules. AWS KMS is integrated with most other AWS services that encrypt your data with encryption keys that you manage. AWS KMS is also integrated with AWS [[CloudTrail]] to provide encryption key usage logs to help meet your auditing, regulatory and compliance needs.
