# AWS Core Services
[[AWS]] offers integration between their services, and because of this services offer a common ground for all of them I think it's a good idea that we review them first so that we can leverage that knowledge when we see more specific ones.

I recommend that you follow this list in order (ordered by importance):

- Authentication and Authorization: [IAM](security_identity_and_compliance/IAM.md)
- Networking: [VPC](networking_and_content_delivery/VPC.md)
- Centralized Logging: [CloudWatch](management_and_governance/CloudWatch.md)
