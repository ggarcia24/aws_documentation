# AWS Core Services
[[AWS]] offers integration between their services, and because of this services offer a common ground for all of them I think it's a good idea that we review them first so that we can leverage that knowled when we see more specific ones.

I recommend that you follow this list in order as I've listed them in the order of importance:

* Authentication and Authorization: [IAM](iam/index.md)
* Networking: [VPC](vpc/index.md)
* Centralized Loggin: [CloudWatch](cloudwatch/index.md)
