- Replicate new objects between buckets
    - Same region 
    - Different region
    - Different accounts
    - Doesn't support DELETE operations yet
- Lifecycle policies
    - Transition Actions: Move objects to other storage class
    - Expiration Actions: Delete objects after some time (including versions)
    - Can apply to prefix or tags
- Versioning of the objects
- Multi-Part upload support
    - Can speed up uploads
    - Recommended for objects > 100Mb
    - Required for objects > 5Gb
- Byte-Range fetches
    - Multi-part downloads
    - partial retrieves (like file headers)
- S3 Transfer Acceleration
    - Accelerate uploads by sending to [[aws_core_concepts#Edge location]]
    - AWS uses private network to move the file to destination
    - Support multi-part uploads
- S3 & Glacier Select
    - Server side filtering
    - Retrieve less data using simple SQL statements
    - Filters by rows and columns
    - Reduces network transfers and CPU costs client side
- Events
    - Enabling versioning makes each version change an event
    - Destinations
        - [[SNS]]
        - [[SQS]]
        - [[Lambda]]

## Security

- It supports [[VPC#Endpoints]] (access to S3 without an internet connection)
- S3 access logs can be stored in other S3 buckets
- API calls can be logged in AWS [[CloudTrail]]
- Pre-signed URLs: URLs that are valid for a small period of time
- Write once read many (WORM) model
    - S3 Object Lock
        - Block object deletion for an specified amount of time
    - Glacier Vault Lock
        - Block future edits

## Notes

## Questions / Flashcards

- What's the Max Object size you can store in an S3 Bucket?:: 5TB
^1609096723026
- How can I upload a 6Gb file to an S3 Bucket?:: Requires 'multi-part upload' for content larger than 5Gb
^1609097273600
- Are changes to objects applied immediately in S3?:: No, S3 uses an [eventually consistent][1] model so you need to take extra precautions if that's part of the requirements (retries, etc)
^1609097635751
- Does S3 support directories? :: There's no concept of directories, files are prefix + object name
^1609096723031
- What's the maximum length for a S3 bucket name? :: Names must be between 3 to 63 characters long
^1609096807102
- Can I create a S3 bucket with the same name on a different region?:: No, buckets must have a globally unique name
^1609097273603
- Who can enable MFA-Delete over an S3 bucket?:: Only the root account can enable MFA Delete and currently only can be done through the CLI
^1610103632851
- How can cheapen S3 bucket costs?:: You can automatically change infrequent accessed files using a lifecycle policy
^1609867319184
- What's the default time for pre-signed URLs in S3?:: The default is for 1h
^1610106796962
- What are the types of encryption S3 supports?:: Server Side Encryption handled by S3, Server Side Encryption handled by [[KMS]], Server Side Encryption with  Custom Key Management, and Client Side Encryption (objects are stored encrypted in S3)
^1609098381532
- In what case it's best to use S3 encryption handled by S3?:: Don't know it yet!
^1609279357564
- In what case it's best to use S3 encryption handled by [[KMS]]?:: Don't know it yet!
^1609279357570
- In what case it's best to use S3 encryption handle by Custom Key?:: Don't know it yet!
^1609279357573
- In what case it's best to use S3 encryption handled by Client Side?:: When there's a requirement for unencrypted data not to be sent to AWS and/or the encryption key should not to be stored in AWS
^1609279357577
- How can I make sure objects in S3 buckets are not deleted by accident?:: Enable MFA Delete in a versioned bucket to  required an extra step to delete objects
^1609097431825
- How can I make sure an object is not deleted from an S3 bucket before an specific amount of time?:: You can use S3 Object Lock
^1610111182046
- How can I make sure an object is not modified from an Glacier Vault before an specific amount of time?:: You can use Glacier Vault Lock
^1610111182053
- To which other AWS services can you send S3 bucket events?:: Currently S3 supports sending events to [[SNS]], [[SQS]], and [[Lambda]]
